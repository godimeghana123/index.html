<p>I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a video of my last lecture, which was not about computer science.</p>
<hr>
<p>Khan Academy now carries algorithms tutorials for which Devin Balkcom and I produced content.</p>
<hr>
<p>Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in Introduction to Algorithms?</p>
<p>If you are, then see the frequently asked question and answer below.</p>
<p>If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.</p>
<hr>
<p>From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the Dartmouth Institute for Writing and Rhetoric.</p>
<p> I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish a list of usage rules that I required my students to observe.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2015, PRI's "The World" ran a story on mentoring women in computer science in which a couple of my students and I were interviewed.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was interviewed for the Command Line Heroes podcast "Learning the BASICs."<br>
    You can also hear me spout off in "Philosophical Trials #7."<br>
    I talked about writing Introduction to Algorithms in an episode of "Frank Stajano Explains."<br>
    And an interview with a Brazilian vlogger.</p>

<h3><p><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></p></h3>
<p>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.</p>
<p>Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to Algorithms:</p>
<dl>
    <dt><i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</i></dt>
    <dd><u>The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022. The MIT Press site for the book has links to sites that sell it.</u>
     </dd>
    <dt><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i></dt>
    <dd>For the fourth edition, we maintain an errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by severity.</dd>
    <dd>For the second and third editions, we maintained an errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about. We stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.</dd>

<h3><i>Algorithms Unlocked</i></h3>
<p>Algorithms Unlocked is a gentler, less technical, entry into algorithms than Introduction to Algorithms. It contains some mathematics, but not nearly as deep as in Introduction to Algorithms. The Amazon site for the book is here, and the MIT Press site is here.</p>
<p><u>I maintain an errata page for Algorithms Unlocked. If you find an error in the book and it's not already in the errata page, send email to algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu. (The email address in the preface of the book is incorrect—the first known error in the book.)</u></p>
